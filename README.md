# before-after.js

## A simple and responsive image comparison slider 

Comparison sliders are nothing new. There are even pure CSS implementations that is nothing but short of amazing. However, I wasnâ€™t able to find a truly responsive one that was simple enough for our needs. This gave me the chance (and excuse) to build one myself that can be used anywhere.

The [Medium article](https://medium.com/p/f3a691a9dd71) details each decision I made along the way.
